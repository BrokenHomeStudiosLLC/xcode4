## XCode 4 Window template + frameworks

![New Project options](https://github.com/j4n0/xcode4/raw/master/pages/newProject.png "New Project options")

This template packs [GH-Unit](https://github.com/gabriel/gh-unit/ "GHUnit"), [MagicalRecord](https://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord "MagicalRecord"), [ASI-HTTP-Request](https://github.com/pokeb/asi-http-request/), [JSONKit](https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit), and [TouchJSON](https://github.com/TouchCode/TouchJSON).  
All frameworks were cloned from github in June 20, 2011. They are all MIT/BSD-like licensed.

I'll add more stuff as I need it. :P
